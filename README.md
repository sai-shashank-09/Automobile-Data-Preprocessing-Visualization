# Automobile Data – Preprocessing & Visualization

## Objective
To clean, preprocess, and analyze automobile data using Python and visualization techniques in order to uncover insights related to vehicle pricing, brand trends, and performance metrics.

## Problem Statement
Raw automobile datasets often contain missing values, inconsistencies, and skewed distributions that limit direct analysis. This project focuses on preparing clean data and exploring relationships between vehicle attributes such as brand, engine size, fuel type, and pricing through effective visualizations.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains automobile specifications including:
- Vehicle specifications: Make, Body Style, Engine Size, Horsepower, Fuel Type
- Efficiency metrics: City MPG, Highway MPG
- Pricing and dimensions: Price, Curb Weight, Length, Width
- Drive information: Drive Wheel, Number of Doors

## Key Analysis Areas
- Vehicle pricing trends and influencing factors
- Brand-wise price comparison
- Engine size and horsepower impact on price
- Fuel type and efficiency analysis
- Design attributes and drive style impact on pricing

## Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap for numerical features
- Bar charts for average price by brand and fuel type
- Boxplots for price distribution across body styles
- Scatter plots for horsepower vs price and engine size vs MPG
- Pairplots for multivariate pattern exploration

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
